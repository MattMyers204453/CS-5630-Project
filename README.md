# CS-5630-Project

## Data
All data used for the project is contained in youtube-data.csv. It contains relevant information on top youtube
channels. Details include subscribers, number of videos, number of total views on a channel, as well as category
and a few other pieces of information. This project largely focused on subscribers, total number of videos, and
total views on a channel.

The top 995 Youtube channels are represented in the data.

## Code
All of the code contained in data.js, main.css, main.js, and project.html were written by Matt Myers and Michael
Kamerath. We used D3 to create the multi bar chart.

## Links

## Features
Clicking on any of the bars highlights that group (subscribers, num videos, total views) and makes the other groups fade
into a more translucent color. Moving the mouse over any bar displays all information for the group in a small translucent
white box near the mouse.
